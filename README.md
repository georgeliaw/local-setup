# Local Machine Setup

This repo is used to configure a fresh local desktop environment to my preferences.

Currently setup for Ubuntu 16.04, migrating to Ubuntu 18.04.

Simply run `install.sh` and follow any prompts that come up.

NOTE: Below notes about Gnome are being deprecated as I'm switching to KDE

### Adding KDE Extensions

- Event Calendar
- Tela Icon Theme

### Adding Gnome Extensions (deprecated)

This will get you some of the extensions that I prefer to use.

Open (Gnome) Tweak Tools and install the following extensions:
- Battery Status
- Dash to Dock
- Dash to Panel
- Clock override
- Applications Menu
- TopIcons Plus
- User Themes
- No Top Left Hot Corner

### Switching Caps Lock Key Behavior (deprecated)
In (Gnome) Tweak Tools, go to `Typing` > `Caps Lock key behavior` > `Make Caps Lock and additional Super`

You can also choose other behaviors if you do not wish to switch your super key to the Caps Lock key.
